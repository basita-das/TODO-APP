# To-Do App

Welcome to the **To-Do App** repository! This app helps users manage their tasks by adding, removing, and marking tasks as completed in a simple and intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed:** Tasks can be marked as completed, with a strikethrough to indicate they are done.
- **Remove Tasks:** Users can remove tasks from the list when they're no longer needed.
- **Persistent Data:** Tasks are stored in the local storage, so they persist even after the page is refreshed.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean, minimal design that is easy to use.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the content.
- **CSS:** For styling the app and layout.
- **JavaScript:** For managing task functionality (adding, removing, completing tasks) and local storage.

## How It Works

- The app allows users to add new tasks by typing in the input field and pressing the "Add" button.
- Each task has options to:
  - **Mark as completed:** Tasks are visually updated with a strikethrough when marked as done.
  - **Remove tasks:** Tasks can be removed from the list by clicking the delete button next to them.
- The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they remain even after refreshing the page.
- The app uses simple JavaScript for the task functionality and DOM manipulation.
